# epoptes

Epoptes (Επόπτης  - a Greek word for overseer) is an [open source](http://gplv3.fsf.org/) computer lab management and monitoring tool. It allows for screen broadcasting and monitoring, remote command execution, message sending, imposing restrictions like screen locking or sound muting the clients and much more!

It can be installed in [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/epoptes), [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/epoptes) and [openSUSE](http://www.epoptes.org/news/opensusepackagesavailable) based labs that may contain *any* combination of the following: [LTSP](http://www.ltsp.org/) servers, [thin](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP) and [fat](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/FatClients) clients, non LTSP servers, standalone workstations, [NX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_technology) or [XDMCP](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/xdmcp) clients etc. Patches for other distros are welcome.

Epoptes has been translated into more than [40 languages](https://translations.launchpad.net/epoptes) and it's being used in many installations all [around the world](http://www.ltsp.org/stories/widget-map). It already has a lot of features, but a lot more are planned, and it's being developed at a very fast [pace](https://github.com/Epoptes/epoptes). It's maintained by IT teachers and students, so it should be around for a long time!
